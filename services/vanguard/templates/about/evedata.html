<h1>About EVEData.org</h1>
<p> EVEData.org has been operating since 2008, originally starting as a market and trade tool for the EVE Online ingame browser using basic HTML. 
    Over time and with changes driven by CCP and other third party devs, the site has been refactored a number of times,
    but remains as a collection of tools that I use in-game for trade or PvP.</p>
<p> The site was originally written in utilizing Linix, Apache (mod_perl), MySQL, and Perl (LAMP). As the second Moondoggie was introduced to the EVE client,
    the website evolved to include more css formatted HTML and better tools with Javascript triggers to control the UI.</p>
<p> The latest version has been rewritten from the ground up as a monolith in Go, utilizing Percona Cluster, and Redis. Prometheus used to track backend metrics.</p>
